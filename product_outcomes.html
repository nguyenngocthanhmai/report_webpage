        The outcomes of our group work this semester is a website to showcase our expected product. Our group used GitHub to host this website, the IDE we use is Visual Studio Code. We put all the content in html file, and css file for styling. In our website, we have 4 main pages: Home page, Our product page, About us and Contact us page. The Home page is where general information about the wheelchair, as well as our group’s slogan and motivation for the project are given. The Our product page outlines the features, tech specifications of our product in an attractive and catchy way. Inside this page, there is a link in the word “Learn more” which leads user to another page with gives more details about our product: Maintenance, Preservation. The About us page gives an explanation of our group name and general details about our members. Finally, the Contact us page is where the customers can reach out to us when they have questions about our product, or need support in operating some components. The Contact us page includes a form for user to enter their personal data and their message to us, our group’s contact information, and a small map that shows the location of our office. This website has been completed and can be shown to potential customers to introduce them about our group’s expected product. Unfortunately, because our team members have not been taught thoroughly how to style with css, or the art of color mix, so we styled our website very simply and the colors used are not professionally chosen, and therefore does not look its best. In the future, if our group could make improvements to it, we would learn how to use different colors together, and perhaps integrate some animations, more interactive features to make it look more user-friendly. In addition, we may consider converting it to an e-commerce website once we have finished building our electric AI-based wheelchair from natural material.
