      <h1 style="color: red;"><i>Sunshine Team</i></h1>
      <p >
        Our team name is determined by the notion of sun and sunlight. Accordingly, the sun provides warm heat which represents the flame of love for IT inside each member. This fire boosts individuals to learn, research, and update IT trends day by day, we also want to design and create a website that can present our products applying IT to support disabled people in the society. Therefore, we collaborate, work, and hope to shine like sunlight successfully together.

      <ul>
        <li style="color:#939B62;; font-size: 20px;" > Vu Minh Ha - s3978681 </li>
        <p>Ha just takes up coding as a serious activity for about three months. Before studying at RMIT, she has learnt coding at high school, taken self-paced courses on freecodecamp, edX and a little web development on The Odin Project. Ha knows how to perform simple programming with HTML, CSS, and Python language. She has a personal interest in logic tasks and web programming.  </p>
        <li style="color:#939B62;; font-size: 20px;">Nguyen Ngoc Thanh Mai – s3978486</li>
        <p>
            Mai wants to become a business analyst in Information and Technology field in the future. When she was in high school, she feared knowledge related to IT such as Arduino in grade 11 and SQL in grade 12. However, destiny brings the IT profession to her, and that is why she is here in this course. Before attending RMIT, Mai learned some basic Python in w3school, and from a reading book, Mai concentrates recently on learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to prepare for Web and Mobile development minor.
        </p>
        <li style="color:#939B62;; font-size: 20px;">Tran Pham Khanh Doan - s3978798</li>
          <p>
            Doan is currently majoring in Information Technology at RMIT University. In her spare time, she enjoys playing tennis and baking cookies. Her IT interest was sparked when she had the opportunity to approach programming with Pascal through Informatics classes. Computer is a magical machine to her. Therefore, she wants to learn and understand how it actually does things. She has experience in building a small website by participating in an online HTML project and she is familiar with CSS. In addition, she is mastering the Python programming language.          </p>
        </li>
        <li style="color:#939B62;; font-size: 20px;">Lee Jae Sung – s3977739</li>
          <p>
            Born and raised in Hanoi with little interest in every activities that he seems to enjoy such as basketball, badminton, and coding. His hobbies are watching films, playing games and fashion. He loves technology but due to little or no knowledge to the topic of the IT world in general, he finds it very hard to understand the working mechanism of most IT-related things. Having no IT experience until this point. His future career is to create an AI that can help people buy stock without any experience and crash the stock market in the further future.           </p>
      </ul>

      <h1 style="color: red;"><i>Group Processes</i></h1>
      <p  style="size: 30px; text-align: left;">
        In the Project proposal, our result was not high because we suffered from many misunderstandings. Nonetheless, we are determined to try our best to enhance the score in this upcoming assignment. Yet we are worried because Our IT World project has a large scale and the challenges that first-year students face. There are many difficult requirements that we are not accustomed to doing, such as writing reports or creating a website. Fortunately, we worked together in the Project proposal, so everything runs straightforward in our initial discussion for this assignment via a face-to-face meeting at the university. We also consulted with each other during the project process through Ms. Teams and direct meetings at school once a week for the members to raise questions that they have while working on the project. Besides, on our Git Hub group repository, which we use to create a website showcase our expected product using HTML we had learned in tutorial class, our group worked collaboratively and harmonically.
      </p>

      <h1 style="color: red;"><i>Career Plan</i></h1>
      <p style="size: 30px; text-align: left;">
        We are freshmen so talking about career plans is quite ambiguous because some of us haven’t explored our strengths and weakness in the IT field yet. Up to this point, most of our team members have plans to work as web developers. However, while Ha, Doan and Sung intend to pursue web development as a career, Mai works in that job to gain the requisite experience for another job. Before working as an IT business analyst, Mai must gain at least two years of experience in a developer position to get the necessary technical skills, so web and mobile development is adjusted for her. Because Ha, Doan and Sung opt for being engaged in web development, they can complete this project's mission effectively and successfully.
