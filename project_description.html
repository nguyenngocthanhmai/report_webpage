      <div class="text" style="size:30px; color: white; background-color: #FFB26B; text-transform: uppercase;">Project Description</div>
      <h1 style="color: red;">Overview</h1>
      <ul>
        <li style="color:#FAAB78">Topic</li>
        <p>In the first assignment, our team had an idea about creating an AI-based autonomous wheelchair from natural materials. However, that topic was too advanced for freshmen like us to complete all requirements for producing a practical AI wheelchair. Therefore, in the Our IT World project, we decide to develop a website to showcase our expected product to potential investors and customers. Our team put necessary elements into our website, such as a Home page, a Our product page (displays the features and components used), a About us page (introduces our team and each members), and a Contact us page. We guarantee that while poking around the website, customers can view the provided detailed information, understand the vision of why our team carries out the AI-based autonomous wheelchair for disabled people, and they will consider buying our product.
          <br>Besides, we will concentrate mostly on the must-have function which is Our Product section. In this section, customers will be able to see the overview of our wheelchair. The vehicle information has been primarily displayed like a portfolio, which contains explanation text lines for every feature including sensors, monitor, and headsets, in parallel with the illustration images. Hence, it allows clients to easily visualize the practical wheelchair after approaching our website. For the good outcome, we decide to use both HTML and CSS tool to complete all developing website requirements from writing codes, customizing, and executing the website. 
        </p>
        <li style="color:#FAAB78">Motivation</li>
        <p>Our team began with an aim to create an IT product that would benefit the society. However, afterwards
          we shifted our focus to disabled people, as we were deeply moved by the story about their life.
          A large number of handicapped individuals in developing countries, such as Vietnam, are going through
          a lot of difficulty in travelling around due to the not fully developed road infrastructure. 
          The notion of automating vehicle is one of the most popular IT trends in the world at the moment. A lot of ‘giant’ corporations, such as Tesla, Google or Intel are all competing in this fierce race. We believe our product could stand out from other similar systems.
          </p>
          <li style="color:#FAAB78">Landscape</li>
          <p>
            Virtually every business today has a website of their own to showcase their product because it is very important that the customers know what services they provide. However, in the field of transportation, some of the famous brands that we know are Vinfast and Toyota. While poking around these websites, they not only teach us how to use websites to implement organizational strategies, but they also orient us in the direction of methods to convert our website development beliefs into practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>* Being one of the most well-known car brands in Viet Nam, Toyota, of course, has a meticulous website with a variety of details, from product specifics and brand history to information on car services containing maintenance, preservation, and discount promotion.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>* Vinfast is well-known for being a rookie in the car industry. As a result, their website appears to be more innovative and up to date. In particular, the features of the website are dynamic with a variety of additional illustrations like gifs, VR, and AR integrated. 
          </p>
      </ul>
      <h1 style="color: red;">Detailed Description</h1>
      <ul>
        <li style="color:#FAAB78">Aims</li>
        <p class="mai-p" style="size: 30px; text-align: left;">
          <b>Single aim: Bring the “electric AI – based wheelchair from natural material” to the market.</b>
          <br>
          Our product for this group project, the electric AI – based autonomous wheelchair is out of our current ability. Therefore, making the portfolio website to showcase and introduce our product to the market is the group’s most recent top priority aim. We believe this electric AI – based wheelchair from natural material is totally new and unique for the customers. Therefore, in order for clients to choose us, we need to develop a distinctive, user-friendly, and comprehensive website that has all the necessary product information.
           
          <ul class="mai-ul">
            There is a long list of objectives that must be achieved through process milestones in order to keep up with the project's aim. However, after generalizing these modest ambitions into a specific circumstance, we came up with the following goals:
          <li>Do research on portfolio type of website: There are many types of website, therefore we need to decide a suitable one for ours. We ended up choosing portfolio type and then find some examples to refer. This task helps us understand and know what we need to put in our website.</li>
          <li>Do research on automotive service industry and automotive website market: Wheelchairs can be legally classified as vehicles, therefore we conduct research on transportation firms, especially brand cars because of their practicality. In order to effectively develop the website architecture for a vehicle brand, this process entails researching the general organizational structure of the company. Additionally, by comprehending how firms organize their websites, we may better preserve our experiences to use websites to draw in customers</li>
          <li>Learn coding and testing HTML and CSS: Learn fundamental principles and practicals for creating website content and images. In order to provide the greatest visuals, team members had to arrange the site items, outline the material, and select images from the Internet. Following that, we will test the smoothness to detect and fix bugs.</li> 
          </ul>


        </p>
        <br>
        <li style="color:#FAAB78">Plan and Progress</li>
          <h2 style ="color: #939B62; text-align: left;">A. Plan</h2>
          <p style="size: 30px; text-align: left;">
           We intend to create an electric AI-based wheelchair from natural material.
          <br>We would go through <b>4 major steps</b> to accomplish this goal:
            <h3>1.Use simulation to train AI how to travel on the road.</h3>
            <br>The software that we would be using is VISTA 2.0. It is an open source driving simulator recently introduced to general public by MIT scientists, which provides training data and a testing environment for people interested in developing automated vehicles. This software is among the most sophisticated ones available because it provides hyper-realistic virtual world and can even simulates several sensors that are used in autonomous transportation.

          <p>
            <h3>2.Create a connection link between the mind-reading device and AI.</h3>
          <br>The mind-reading device we would be using is AlterEgo headset which is invented by scientists from MIT University. AI is embedded in a computer. AlterEgo is reported to be capable of interacting with AI-based appliances. Therefore, a connection between the mind-reading gadget and AI in the computer could be established. Any instructions made in the user’s mind could be transferred to AI to carry out.

            <h3>3.Build a physical wheelchair:</h3>
            <br>This is a demonstration image of how the wheelchair should be like.
            <br>

            <br>- A computer is placed on a support stand behind the chair. The computer used is IP69K of Teguar Computers. We use this product because it is especially suitable for use in outdoor condition: waterproof, corrosion-resistant, antibacterial, and can expect a ten-year lifespan.</p>

          <p>
            -	For the computer to see the surrounding: use cameras.
<br>* On the computer itself, there are two broad-view cameras, one at the front and the other at the back.
<br>* Around the wheelchair, we attach four medium-range cameras on the four sides of the chair.
<br><br>-	However, a camera alone may make it hard for the computer to fully acknowledge the world, therefore we would use sensors to augment this understanding.
<br>* <b>Lidar</b> (light detection and ranging): monitor the vehicle’s surroundings.
<br>* <b>Ultrasonic sensors</b>: to measure the position of objects very close to the vehicle.
<br><br>-	GPS would be installed in our computer, the map used is high-definition (HD) map.
<br><br>-	Other physical components of our product are similar to those of a standard electric wheelchair, which has a knob on the armrest for vehicle control, except that the chassis of model is made from biocomposite. In order to produce this electric wheelchair, we would search for a manufacturer who is a specialist in this area.
<br><br>-	We also install <b>the shock absorber</b> for the wheels. 
Whenever the wheels are rolling along the street, it cannot avoid vibrations. In some cases, users have no choice but to travel through bumpy roads if they are to reach their destination. A “shock absorber” would support them in minimizing shock and vibrations caused to the wheels during the journey. This product would help to maintain the accurate operation of electrical components (and therefore ensures the safety of users), which in the long run may also reduce maintenance costs and downtime.

          <h3 style="text-align:left">4.Product testing</h3>
          <p style="size: 30px; text-align: left;">
            We would let our product function in trial for 8 to 12 months. Afterwards, we would send it to a quality assurance department to gain a certificate, before officially launching it to the market. After the launch, we would constantly do research to improve our algorithms as new daily problems could occur and prevent our product from functioning correctly.
          </p>

          <h2 style ="color: #939B62; text-align: left;">B. Progress</h2>
          <p style="size: 30px; text-align: left;">
            This topic is highly advanced, and our ability is not yet sufficient to carry out this whole project. All of our group members are first semester students, so we decide to pause at creating a website to showcase our expected product. To carry out this Assignment, first Ha created a new timetable because the timetable that she made in the Project proposal was outdated and no longer meets the needs. This was because in the Project proposal, she did not fully understand the requirements in the Final report, one of which is actually building something for the project. Therefore, she set inappropriate tasks. In the new timetable, there are four major tasks, which are: final report writing, making product-showcase website, preparing for the presentation, and converting the final report to html format. All members have a role in each mentioned task. Two weeks are spent on report writing and making the website for our expected product, two days on presentation practice and nearly five days to convert the final report to html format. 
 
<br><br>For our product website, we have referenced to those of famous brands such as Toyota or Honda to learn what type of information they would put on their website. We also look at some website formats advertised on the Internet to get an idea how to organize our page to make it attractive. We believe that a standard website would consist of a Home page, a page that outlines the functionalities of the product, a page to introduce the manufacturer team, and a contact page. To complete this task, our group divided the workload and assigned to each member: Ha does the Home page, Mai does the About us and Contact us page, Doan and Sung does the Our product page. We created a group repository on GitHub. Initially, the repo only contained an index.html file and a README.md file. After that, each member cloned the repo to their local device, created a file according to their assigned task and work on it via Visual Studio Code. Ha finished and pushed her index.html file first, because the Home page would be used as a design template for other pages. Afterwards, the other members pushed their file later. However, a problem that we identified then was that the design format of the pages that the other members made are different from the Home page. This was probably because each member was already doing the styling to their own file before Ha officially pushed her index.html file. Modifications were not simple to make and it took our group some time to fix. Fortunately, we managed to resolve the issue and our website is now complete. 
 
<br><br>For the moment, these are what we are able to accomplish within the time of a semester and our knowledge. In the future, we intend to raise capitals for our project. When we receive enough sponsorship, we would hire a front-end web developer to make our website look more professional. In addition, after we have learnt more and gained a broader range of knowledge, we might consider working together as a group to continue this project or collaborate with experts around the world.

We used it in making our group’s product-showcase website, as well as the group website. We used the free version of GitHub, which can satisfy all of our current needs. It does not require any hardware. In class, our team has been taught on how to use this to collaborate as team, host our group repository as a page, and more.

        <p>Our group created the showcase website using HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code. In the process, we would test if our website appears as it should by opening the file in browser mode. After writing some lines of code, we would reload the browser page and see the changes. If there are parts that are faulty, we would fix right away. For the CSS file, we can also use the “Inspect element” function of Chrome browser to see the details of different objects on the page.   </p>

                Styling with CSS is not easy to learn. When you search on the Internet how to style an element in a particular way, the search result might not display the one that you want because the scope of css styling is large.

                Merging work of all members to the main branch cannot be done right away because GitHub detect conflicts. Require manual modifications to resolve the issue.

                The main branch on GitHub is not protected and someone accidentally push their file or make direct modifications there instead of creating a branch.

          After completing the first assignment together, we continued to work together as a group. We interact by using the Messenger group chat that was created at the beginning. We choose to hold face-to-face meetings once a week because we understand how crucial communication is to the success of this project. During the first meeting, we made the decision to assign tasks for each member. To decide which work each person will be in charge of, we also employ a poll. Many other group members were able to communicate with one another successfully. Using the group chat, we assist one another by clarifying their questions about the requirement of the assignment, suggest modifications to their writing work, fix the bug in the html/css file,.. so that our group work could be finished quickly. Additionally, each member uses Google Docs to manage the parts in the report that they write, which makes it simple for us to modify or alter their words. Even though we don’t communicate with one another all the time, we chose to split the assignments up into smaller tasks and give them due dates, after the due date we would compare them to one another. A group member will respond as soon as they can to a message sent in the group chat by a group member in need of assistance. As a consequence, our team has become closer and is now more readily and adaptably able to work together.
