          In the Project Proposal, our group stumbled many times, from mistakenly writing an analysis report, to including irrelevant sections. However, moving to “Our IT World” assignment, I have learnt to make more contact with my team, discussed with them carefully before doing tasks. Through that I discovered their ability. I was surprised at the ideas they could think of. They were innovative and reasonable. What’s more, I found out that they were good at self-studying. When encountering parts that they did not have much knowledge, they would actively do their own research. An example for this was our group’s use of CSS to style our website. Most of us knew little CSS, but each member wanted to make the website attractive, so we all voluntarily learnt. When I saw the completed pages that other members made, I was impressed at how good it looked. Personally, I believe that in assignment, what went well was our ability to work as a team to the end. We stayed self-disciplined to finish the assigned tasks and respectful of others’ opinions. If there is a thing to improve, I would say it is our ability to make good forward planning.

          I would say there are many meaningful lessons and experience that I can gain in this course. In the project proposal, our team got out of topic for the first draft and then chose the too advanced topic for that assignment. Therefore, we were stumbled in many sections and our result was also unexpected. Moving to the Our It World project, we decide to develop a fundamental website which helps us to execute this project smoothly. However, I am honestly not pleased with this project outcomes and my performance because I feel that everything in the project is not fully made from developing website to presentation section. Although it sounds negative, if we have any opportunities to cooperate again, there are some weaknesses that we should redemy such as choosing suitable topic in our capability is the most essential part, group meeting should be more productive, and more discussion. To conclude, thank to this project and my teammates because I learn how to cooperate effective and the way to summarize different ideas for the final product. I can also brush up my knowledge about HTML and CSS and find my fascination in web development.

          Throughout my teamwork, I had the wonderful opportunity to learn about and experience many different parts of what goes into a project, including the fundamental procedure of how a project is initially conceived, developed, and concluded, as well as how much effort and detail goes into every stage. This actual assignment also helped me understand what I had been confused about during lectures. In this project, I had the chance to apply the knowledge that has been taught in class and improve my skills in coding. I learned HTML and CSS, as well as Visual Studio Code, the source code that I use to develop the website. Making my own website is the thing that surprised me the most. Furthermore, CSS fascinates me, and I want to master more about it. I am convinced that the most significant skill I gained from this assignment was cooperation. We all try to support each other in finishing the tasks. I would also want to thank my teammates, who have been committed to the project throughout the working process.

          A project about the AI wheelchair is not easy for first sem-university students. Although the difficulties that I and the group were facing such as the new year break that broke our flow of work and the HTML web that present our concept AI wheelchair all due in less than 2 weeks to finish, we were able to finish it on time. There are some aspects that we should improve such as the group meeting should be more productive and the group contribution of work and the limitation as a whole individual so the aim of our group project could be suitable for a first sem student. The time that I worked with the group helped me with a lot of things such as my skills individually and my group skills. I began to contribute more to the group and not be afraid to raise any idea that I have that could help the team in general. This project is a great opportunities for me to gain knowledge about the AI field and IT field also improving the individual skills that I may lacking in the professional field later on in the future.
